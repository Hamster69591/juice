**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Player and their best friend are trapped in a simulation and must escape by solving puzzles.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Reality is constantly changing around the player, and the player must solve unique 2D puzzles (like the tasks from among us) to progress and escape.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player moves throughought levels/worlds, exploring their environment and trying to move on to the next by solving puzzles. By completing worlds, they unlock new items and outfits that can help them progress.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Make the puzzles and exploration satisfying and keep things pretty limited to that.
