# Game Name  
**Dimension Dash**  

**Team Member:** Alex  

**Pitch:**  
"An endless runner where you switch between 2D and 3D to overcome obstacles and uncover hidden paths."  

**Key Mechanic(s):**  
- **Dimension Switch:** Players can switch between 2D and 3D at any time.  
  - In **2D**: Focus on precise platforming, jumps, and timing.  
  - In **3D**: Focus on spatial awareness, dodging, and navigating complex routes.  
- **Interactive Elements:** Some obstacles or platforms only exist in one dimension (e.g., a block visible in 2D but invisible in 3D).  

**Core Game Loop:**  
1. **Running & Jumping:** Players dodge obstacles and collect points/items.  
2. **Dimension Switch:** When a path seems impossible, players switch dimensions to find a solution.  
3. **Checkpoint System:** Players can save their progress at specific points.  
4. **Increasing Difficulty:** As the game progresses, the pace increases, and frequent dimension switching becomes necessary.  

**Engagement Plan:**  
- **Power-Ups:** Items that stabilize dimensions, provide speed boosts, or grant temporary invincibility.  
- **Level Events:** Dynamic changes like collapsing buildings or rotating platforms force strategic thinking.  
- **Achievements & Unlocks:** New characters, skins, or abilities rewarded for progress.  
- **Leaderboard & Challenges:** Players compete for high scores or complete specific challenges.
